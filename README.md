# Genetic-Algorithm
A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation. The process of natural selection starts with the selection of fittest individuals from a population. They produce offspring which inherit the characteristics of the parents and will be added to the next generation. If parents have better fitness, their offspring will be better than parents and have a better chance at surviving. This process keeps on iterating and at the end, a generation with the fittest individuals will be found.  This notion can be applied for a search problem. We consider a set of solutions for a problem and select the set of best ones out of them.  Five phases are considered in a genetic algorithm.      Initial population     Fitness function     Selection     Crossover     Mutation
